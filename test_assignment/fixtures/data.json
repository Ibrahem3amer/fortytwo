Interested in many core sciences like: Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, and Design Patterns. Looking forward to pushing all effective technologies to my own stack of knowledge. I'm a man of challenges, I love them and they seem to do so. I like the idea of spreading knowledge and facilitating sciences, I'm working on educational project that aims to operate with these matters. I love innovation and creation and that's why I decided to be a programmer, hoping that I could have this magic wand that creates and shapes the modern world.",
